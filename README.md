A couple of tools I have made myself to help me to test some of Epitech projects, maybe you find them useful.

## Project list

Name | Usage | Description
--- | --- | ---
Collision map | my_sokoban, my_rpg | Generates a collision map file from the user input.
my_radar data generator | my_radar | Generates a data file according to the user preferences.
